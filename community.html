                We have initiated a club in our school community to promote
                future engagement in the technological industry. To keep this
                excitement of technology alive and to create additional
                enthusiasm for this industry, we have started a coding club. In
                our coding club, we cover the basics of coding and go all the
                way to web development. We have three categories: beginner,
                intermediate and advanced. We hope to help our club members
                achieve the best of their abilities and help them learn coding
                in an interesting way. Over 40 students have decided to join our
                coding club to enrich their knowledge of coding. Later in the
                year, we hope to start a robotics club. Our robotics club will
                integrate the skills and basic interpretation of coding into
                mechanical terms. This will help the students in our school
                deliver what they can imagine through the notion of technology.
                We strongly believe that technology is the foundation of the
                future, and weâ€™ve come together to provide our school with these
                clubs to help them greet the future with some understanding of
                technology.
