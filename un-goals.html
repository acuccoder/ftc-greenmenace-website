                A major part of F.I.R.S.T is giving back to the community. That
                is why we believe that our robot is proudly designed to help
                work towards the UN goals. As this season's challenge focuses on
                a deep dive into one of the most interesting areas of our
                planet, we decided to focus on UN Goal 14: life below water.
                Large and small bodies of water across the world have been
                contaminated by excessive ocean bed mining and offshore drilling
                combined with the already high number of waste in the ocean. Our
                robot hopes to help reduce the number of waste that is in our
                oceans through artificial intelligence and human-controlled
                movement. We have designed our robot in order to be able to find
                waste from sea life and use its claws to grab it and help it
                resurface to be collected by a human player. In our imagination,
                we think of the specimen and samples as the waste and the human
                player to be the helper. The baskets and the rungs are the
                places where the robot chooses to sort these materials into the
                right location. We believe that if others were to take our robot
                idea and utilize it to create a working robot that could do as
                we mentioned, but in an actual scenario, it would greatly
                benefit the world.
